In some English words, a letter appears more than once. Search through a sample of text to find the word with a letter that is repeated more times than any other letter is repeated in any other word. If there is a tie between two words, then choose the first word in the text sample. 

The text sample will contain only the alphabetic characters ("a" through "z" and "A" through "Z"), spaces, and punctuation marks. A letter is considered to be the same letter regardless of whether it appears in uppercase or lowercase. 

The words will be separated by spaces, and any punctuation marks should be disregarded. 

A function that accepts the string path to a sample text file as its argument, and returns the correct word from the sample text as its output. 

Each sample text is stored in a text file. 

<h2>Example A: </h2>

<b>Input:</b> "O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?" 

<b>Output:</b> "wherefore" 

Explanation: The letter "e" is repeated three times in the word "wherefore" and this is more than any other letter is repeated in any other word! 

<h2>Example B: </h2>

<b>Input:</b> "Some people feel the rain, while others just get wet." 

<bOutput:</b> "people" 

Explanation: Both "people" and "feel" have a letter that is repeated twice within the word. This is a tie-- and the first word wins!
